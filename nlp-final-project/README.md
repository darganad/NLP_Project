# NLP Final Project

Team Nietzsche

## Description

This project has two applications in it. First, an application that reads in
an article and content questions about the article and second, an application
that attempts to autonomously answer questions about the article.

## Usage

> ./run-ask \[path to article\] \[number of questions\]

> ./run-answer \[path to article\] \[path to questions file\]

**Class**

some ideas to start with. Also, the TAs provided numerous tips that we don't
